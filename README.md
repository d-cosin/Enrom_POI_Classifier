# Enron_POI_Classifier

Repositary used for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree 5th Project: Identify Fraud from Enrom Email.

The project explores a dataset containing Enron former employees' financial and email data. The main goal is to come up with a machine learning model able to efficiently classify the employees as a Person of Interest (POI) probably involved in corruption mechanisms. Different classification models are trained and tested, checking their performances metrics, and, optimizing their hyperparameters.

The repo is composed of:

* **final_report.md:** report describing the problem, the methodology and the results obtained;
* **poi_id.py:** main Python script with Data Cleaning and Machine Learning stages;
* **tester_custom.py:** evaluation module customized to return the evaluation metrics;
* **aux_functions:** auxiliary functions called by *poi_id.py*;
* **pickle files:** results generated by *poi_id.py*;
* **figures:** images used by *final_report.md*.
