* **final_report.md:** report describing the problem, the methodology and the results obtained;
* **poi_id.py:** main Python script with Data Cleaning and Machine Learning stages;
* **tester_custom.py:** evaluation module customized to return the evaluation metrics;
* **aux_functions:** auxiliary functions called by *poi_id.py*;
* **pickle files:** results generated by *poi_id.py*;
* **figures:** images used by *final_report.md*.
